# PhoneBook
C# sql database
I have been learning c# for at least 1,5 months and this is the 2nd program that I can call as a program. Because the first version
of this program was open to SQL injections and I did not code in a clean and understandable way. But in this one I think my code is quite understandable and clean

I hope I will put more program to here.

this program is just a small program to manage your phone numbers. You can display,save,update and delete your phone numbers.
